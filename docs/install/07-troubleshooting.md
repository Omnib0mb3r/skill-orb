# 07: Troubleshooting

> Symptom-driven fixes. Find the symptom you're seeing, follow the steps.

## "ollama unreachable"

**Where you see this:** `npm run status`, `daemon.log`, ingest output.

**Cause:** ollama isn't running, or `DEVNEURAL_OLLAMA_HOST` points at the wrong place.

**Fix:**
```powershell
# Check whether ollama is running
curl http://localhost:11434/api/tags

# If that fails, launch the desktop app or:
ollama serve
```

If you've changed the host:
```powershell
echo $env:DEVNEURAL_OLLAMA_HOST
```
Should be empty (defaults to `http://localhost:11434`) or a valid URL.

---

## "model qwen3:8b not pulled"

**Where:** daemon.log on first ingest, status output.

**Fix:**
```powershell
ollama pull qwen3:8b
```

If qwen3:8b is unavailable in your ollama version:
```powershell
ollama pull qwen2.5:7b-instruct
[Environment]::SetEnvironmentVariable("DEVNEURAL_OLLAMA_MODEL", "qwen2.5:7b-instruct", "User")
```
Then restart your shell so the new env var takes effect.

---

## Hooks aren't firing (no observations being captured)

**Symptom:** `C:/dev/data/skill-connections/projects/<id>/observations.jsonl` doesn't exist or isn't growing.

**Possible causes and fixes:**

1. **Hook not installed.** Run:
   ```powershell
   cd C:/dev/Projects/DevNeural/07-daemon
   npm run install-hooks
   ```

2. **Hook installed but Claude Code isn't seeing it.** Restart Claude Code. Hook config is read at session startup, not hot-reloaded.

3. **Hook is being skipped by guards.** Check `daemon.log` for "skipped" entries. Likely causes:
   - `CLAUDE_CODE_ENTRYPOINT` env not in allowed list (`cli`, `sdk-ts`, `claude-desktop`, `claude-vscode`)
   - `DEVNEURAL_HOOK_PROFILE=minimal` set
   - `DEVNEURAL_SKIP_OBSERVE=1` set
   - cwd matches a path in `DEVNEURAL_OBSERVE_SKIP_PATHS`
   - `.devneural-ignore` file at the project root

4. **dist not built.** Run `npm run build` and verify `dist/capture/hooks/hook-runner.js` exists.

5. **Settings.json is malformed.** Check Claude Code's startup output for errors. Restore from `~/.claude/settings.json.devneural.bak` and re-run `install-hooks`.

---

## Daemon won't lazy-start

**Symptom:** hook fires, but no daemon comes up. `npm run status` shows daemon=warn.

**Causes:**

1. **Port 3747 already in use.**
   ```powershell
   netstat -ano | findstr :3747
   ```
   Either kill the offender or set `DEVNEURAL_PORT` to a free port.

2. **Spawn lock stuck.**
   ```powershell
   Remove-Item C:/dev/data/skill-connections/daemon.lock -Recurse -Force -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue
   ```

3. **Stale PID file.**
   ```powershell
   Remove-Item C:/dev/data/skill-connections/daemon.pid -Force -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue
   ```

4. **dist not built.** `npm run build` in `07-daemon`.

5. **Node not on PATH for the spawned process.** Verify `where node` returns a path. If not, fix PATH.

After fixing, manually start to verify:
```powershell
node C:/dev/Projects/DevNeural/07-daemon/dist/daemon.js
```
Watch for errors. Once it's healthy, kill it (`Ctrl+C`) and let the next hook event lazy-start it normally.

---

## "fetch failed" during ingest, even though ollama is up

**Cause:** ollama process crashed mid-call, or the model failed to load (e.g. out of memory).

**Fix:**
1. Restart ollama
2. Try a smaller model: `DEVNEURAL_OLLAMA_MODEL=qwen2.5:7b-instruct` (or `:3b` if you're tight)
3. Check ollama logs: usually printed to its own console window

The corpus seed will resume on its own after 3 consecutive failures (the abort-after-failures guard).

---

## Wiki pages aren't being created

**Symptom:** ingest runs without errors but `wiki/pending/` stays empty.

**Cause hierarchy:**

1. **`new_page_warranted: false` from Pass 1.** The LLM is saying "no new transferable insight here." This is often correct for short tool calls, syntax questions, or content that's just running existing patterns. Look at `daemon.log` for ingest events; if every ingest reports `affected_candidates=0, new_page_warranted=false`, the model is being too conservative.

2. **Pass 2 producing pages that fail validation.** Check daemon.log for `pass2 failed after N attempts`. The validator is rejecting outputs because:
   - Title missing `→`
   - Summary too long
   - No evidence cited
   - Body too long

   The repair retry should handle most. If it consistently fails, the local model is producing weak structured output. Try a stronger model.

3. **Schema document is wrong.** If you've edited `wiki/DEVNEURAL.md` heavily, the LLM may be following bad instructions. Restore from `docs/spec/DEVNEURAL.md`:
   ```powershell
   Copy-Item C:/dev/Projects/DevNeural/docs/spec/DEVNEURAL.md C:/dev/data/skill-connections/wiki/DEVNEURAL.md
   ```

---

## Search returns nothing

**Symptom:** `POST /search` returns empty results even though you've used the system for a while.

**Causes:**

1. **Embedder didn't load.** First call is slow (model download). If it errored, see daemon.log. Try a manual warm:
   ```powershell
   curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{\"q\":\"hello\",\"collection\":\"raw_chunks\"}' http://127.0.0.1:3747/search
   ```

2. **No content to find.** Check vector store sizes via `/health`. If both `raw_chunks` and `wiki_pages` are 0, capture isn't producing or hasn't been triggered yet.

3. **Wrong collection.** Search defaults to `raw_chunks`. Try with `"collection":"wiki_pages"`.

---

## Claude isn't using my injected context

**Symptom:** UserPromptSubmit hook fires, `/curate` returns a non-empty injection, but Claude's reply doesn't seem to use it.

**Possible explanations:**

1. **Injection actually IS being used, but subtly.** The reinforcement loop measures cosine of reply vs page summary. Check `reinforcement.log.jsonl` for hit/no-hit decisions. Cosine threshold is 0.65 by default; lower it if you're sure pages are helping but not crossing the bar:
   ```powershell
   [Environment]::SetEnvironmentVariable("DEVNEURAL_HIT_COSINE", "0.55", "User")
   ```

2. **Page is irrelevant.** Cosine search returned a page because nothing else was closer, but the page wasn't actually a fit. Increase the floor:
   ```powershell
   [Environment]::SetEnvironmentVariable("DEVNEURAL_COSINE_FLOOR_WIKI", "0.65", "User")
   ```
   Better to inject nothing than wrong context.

3. **Claude saw the injection but chose not to use it.** That's the system working correctly; the page wasn't actually useful for THIS prompt. Reinforcement will adjust.

---

## Reinforcement isn't updating page weights

**Symptom:** Pages always at weight 0.30, no hits, no corrections recorded.

**Cause:** the transcript watcher isn't seeing assistant turns, or the pending-injection tracker is timing out before the reply.

**Fix:**

1. Verify transcript watcher is running:
   ```powershell
   curl http://127.0.0.1:3747/health
   ```
   Should report `phase: P5-reinforcement` or later.

2. Check `daemon.log` for `[transcript-watcher]` lines as you use Claude. Should show `+N chunks` events.

3. If the reply takes longer than 10 minutes (PENDING_TTL), the pending injection is dropped. Reinforcement only fires if the reply lands within that window.

---

## SQLite "database is locked"

**Cause:** previous daemon crashed without releasing the WAL.

**Fix:**
```powershell
taskkill /F /PID (Get-Content C:/dev/data/skill-connections/daemon.pid) -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue
Remove-Item C:/dev/data/skill-connections/index.db-shm -Force -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue
Remove-Item C:/dev/data/skill-connections/index.db-wal -Force -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue
node C:/dev/Projects/DevNeural/07-daemon/dist/daemon.js
```

---

## Wiki git repo has conflicts

**Symptom:** daemon.log reports git commit failures during ingest.

**Cause:** something else (you, a backup tool) modified a file in `wiki/` while the daemon was about to commit.

**Fix:**
```powershell
cd C:/dev/data/skill-connections/wiki
git status
git stash      # or git add -A && git commit -m "manual"
```

---

## Disk almost full

**Symptom:** writes failing, daemon erroring.

**Where space goes:**

```powershell
# Top directories
Get-ChildItem C:/dev/data/skill-connections -Recurse -Directory | Measure-Object -Property Length -Sum
```

Likely culprits:
- Old observation archives — auto-purge after 30 days but verify
- `chroma/collections/` — grows with usage
- `models/` — only ~90MB but could be more if you've installed multiple
- Daemon log — rotates? not in v1; manually truncate if huge

To manually truncate the log:
```powershell
Stop-Service ... # if you've made daemon a service
Clear-Content C:/dev/data/skill-connections/daemon.log
```

To manually purge old archive data:
```powershell
Get-ChildItem C:/dev/data/skill-connections/projects/*/observations.archive -File | Where-Object { $_.LastWriteTime -lt (Get-Date).AddDays(-30) } | Remove-Item
```

---

## Hook firing on every keystroke / too noisy

**Cause:** unlikely for hooks themselves (Claude Code only fires PreToolUse / PostToolUse on actual tool calls), but if you're seeing absurd hook frequency, check:

1. The `signal_every_n` throttle (default 20 events). Daemon doesn't process every observation; it batches.
2. Whether you accidentally enabled some other tool's hook chain that's flapping.

For now: not a known DevNeural failure mode.

---

## Audio upload says "transcript_extracted: 0" or daemon log shows "whisper exited with code 1"

**Cause:** `DEVNEURAL_WHISPER_BIN` is set to `C:\dev\whisper.cpp\Release\main.exe`. Recent whisper.cpp builds replaced `main.exe` with a deprecation stub that prints a warning and exits without transcribing. The audio module then sees no `.txt` output and reports failure.

**Fix:**
```powershell
setx DEVNEURAL_WHISPER_BIN "C:\dev\whisper.cpp\Release\whisper-cli.exe"
# Restart the daemon so the new env value is inherited
taskkill /F /PID (Get-Content C:/dev/data/skill-connections/daemon.pid) -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue
cd C:\dev\Projects\DevNeural\07-daemon; powershell -File scripts\start-daemon.ps1
```

Alternative: unset the env var entirely so `audio.ts` falls back to its built-in path list (which already prefers `whisper-cli.exe` over `main.exe`).

---

## PostToolUse / PreToolUse hook errors: "silent-shim.exe: silent-shim.exe: cannot execute"

**Cause:** older `silence-all-hooks.ps1` versions used cmd-style `""` to escape inner-arg quotes. Bash (Claude Code's shell on Windows) treats `""` as empty-string concatenation, so the inner exe path collapses with its arguments and `silent-shim` tries to launch a path fragment.

**Fix:**
```powershell
cd C:\dev\Projects\DevNeural\07-daemon
powershell -File scripts\reescape-hook-args.ps1   # one-shot: rewrites "" -> \"
```

If you ever ran an old `silence-all-hooks.ps1` more than once, the detection regex bug may also have wrapped your hooks in two layers of `silent-shim`. Repair with:
```powershell
powershell -File scripts\repair-double-wrapped-hooks.ps1   # peels one shim layer where double-wrapped
```

Both scripts back up `~/.claude/settings.json` before writing and accept `-DryRun` to preview. Re-running `silence-all-hooks.ps1` is idempotent on the corrected state.

---

## "I don't know what changed but it's slow"

```powershell
cd C:/dev/Projects/DevNeural/07-daemon
npm run status
Get-Content C:/dev/data/skill-connections/daemon.log -Tail 100
curl http://127.0.0.1:3747/health
```

Share the output with whoever is helping (or your future self via memory).

---

## Total reset (nuclear option)

If everything is broken and you've tried the tier 1-4 recoveries in `06-recovery-and-reconstruction.md`:

```powershell
# Stop daemon
taskkill /F /PID (Get-Content C:/dev/data/skill-connections/daemon.pid) -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue

# Backup everything you might want
$stamp = Get-Date -Format 'yyyyMMdd-HHmmss'
Compress-Archive C:/dev/data/skill-connections "C:/Backups/devneural-everything-$stamp.zip"

# Restore Claude settings.json from backup
Copy-Item $env:USERPROFILE\.claude\settings.json.devneural.bak $env:USERPROFILE\.claude\settings.json -Force

# Wipe DevNeural data + dist
Remove-Item C:/dev/data/skill-connections -Recurse -Force
Remove-Item C:/dev/Projects/DevNeural/07-daemon/dist -Recurse -Force
Remove-Item C:/dev/Projects/DevNeural/07-daemon/node_modules -Recurse -Force

# Reinstall
cd C:/dev/Projects/DevNeural/07-daemon
npm install
npm run setup
```

Done. Anything important is in the backup zip.

---

## When in doubt

Run, in order:
1. `cd 07-daemon && npm run status`
2. `Get-Content C:/dev/data/skill-connections/daemon.log -Tail 50`
3. `curl http://127.0.0.1:3747/health`

These three answer most "is something wrong" questions in 30 seconds.
