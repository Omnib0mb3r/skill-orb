# Session handover

> Pick up where the last session left off. Designed to be the first file a new Claude (or you) reads when starting fresh.
> Last updated: 2026-05-04 (post wiki backfill, orb visual rewrite, bridge auto-detect, terminal-mode flip).

> **State now:** All Phase 3.x dashboard work is shipped. Wiki backfill of 168MB / 180 historical Claude session jsonl files is complete (116 wiki pages, 5185 raw chunks, 81 graph edges). Orb visual rewrite landed (curved bezier edges + custom particles + breathing glow + screen-stable widths + isolation/gravity forces + connected-subgraph framing). VS Code session-bridge now auto-detects the Claude terminal via process-tree walk, no manual mapping required. User has flipped `claudeCode.useTerminal: true` so future sessions are remote-driveable from the dashboard. Daemon autostart task installed and verified (logon + 5min repeat watchdog). PWA brand icons generated. Off-site weekly backup script ready (not yet installed).

## Where we are

DevNeural v2 is a local-first second brain: capture, semantic RAG, learning wiki, real-time recommendation, reinforcement, and a central dashboard. Phases 1 - 3.x done. The full loop "host → daemon → dashboard → bridge → claude terminal" is closed; next concrete work is whatever the user identifies as the next bug.

## TL;DR

- **Identity is "second brain."** Not a metaphor. Six properties: persistent memory, semantic recall, watches without being asked, surfaces in real time, compounds with use, lives on local hardware. See `docs/spec/devneural-v2.md` section 0.
- **Two layers: semantics + logic.** Semantics = embeddings, vector search, fuzzy recall. Logic = `[trigger] → [insight]` schema, validation, promotion rules, hard editorial rules. Both required. See section 7.
- **Read first:** `README.md` (top-level), then `docs/spec/devneural-v2.md` for architecture, then `docs/spec/DEVNEURAL.md` for the wiki schema, then this file.
- **Phase status:** 1, 2, 3.1 - 3.12 done. 4 (orb visual rewrite) done. 5 (settings audit + autostart + backup tasks) done.
- **Today's headline shipments (2026-05-04):**
  - Wiki backfill from history complete (168MB / 180 jsonl files, 116 wiki pages indexed, 5185 raw chunks, /graph returns 81 edges).
  - Orb rewrite: curved bezier edges + custom particles drawn in same closure, screen-stable widths, breathing glow, animated promoted ring, isolation-pull + global-gravity forces, connected-subgraph framing.
  - Wiki search: per-collection grouped sections + per-section pagination, wiki-page modal with Pattern/Evidence/Cross-refs/Log + clickable session UUIDs in evidence + Related Transcripts vector search.
  - Session detail: terminal-styled transcripts (`> ai` / `> you` / `> tool`), full-jsonl scan when `?q=` is set so search hits found anywhere highlight properly.
  - Stream Deck Nav mode: 5x3 hardware-mirror grid with mic + arrows + numbers, owns its own bezier + particles.
  - Session-bridge: auto-detects Claude terminal via Win32 process-tree walk (no manual mapping). Strict, never auto-injects into unrelated shells. Per-workspace offset persistence so VS Code reload doesn't replay backlog.
  - Daemon autostart Task Scheduler entry installed and verified (logon trigger + 5-min watchdog repeat with cheap /health probe short-circuit).
  - PWA icons generated, off-site backup task script ready, whisper.cpp Release/ fallback path so audio uploads auto-resolve.
- **Branch:** `master`. All work is on master, no feature branches.
- **Local-first:** ollama with `qwen3:8b` is the LLM. No API keys required. Anthropic SDK installed, used only if `DEVNEURAL_LLM_PROVIDER=anthropic`.
- **Daemon binds `0.0.0.0:3747` by default** so Tailscale routes in. `DEVNEURAL_BIND=127.0.0.1` reverts to local only.
- **No em dashes anywhere.** Per global CLAUDE.md. Use periods, commas, colons, semicolons, parens, hyphens. Applies to chat output, code comments, commit messages, docs.
- **No AI co-author tags** in commits. Ever.

## What was done in Phase 3 (sub-phases 3.1, 3.2, 3.3)

### Phase 3.1: Daemon API extensions (commit `6b6c1eb`)

New module `07-daemon/src/dashboard/`:
- `auth.ts` — PIN authentication. Bcrypt-hashed PIN at `dashboard/auth.json`. Signed session cookie (HMAC-SHA256, per-install secret). Lockout after 5 wrong PINs in 60s for 5 minutes. First-run = no PIN means open access.
- `system-metrics.ts` — CPU (sampled %, load avg), memory, disks (PowerShell on Windows), process info, ollama reachability, data root size with 60s cache.
- `services.ts` — config-driven status manifest at `dashboard/config.jsonc`. Defaults: daemon, ollama, wiki git, tailscale, internet. Per-check kind (http, file, cmd). Returns rollup ok/warn/fail.
- `sessions.ts` — lists Claude sessions on host by reading `~/.claude/projects/<slug>/<sid>.jsonl`. Per-session detail with rolling summary, current task, last N transcript chunks (tail-read, never full file). Queues prompts to `session-bridge/<sid>.in`.
- `daily-brief.ts` — surfaces `wiki/whats-new.md` plus structured summary.
- `search-all.ts` — unified search over wiki_pages + raw_chunks + reference_chunks. Merge by score with source tag.
- `reminders.ts` — append-only jsonl event log replayed into current state. Create/update/complete/uncomplete/archive/delete.
- `notifications.ts` — append-only jsonl with event-bus emission. Severity (info/warn/alert), source tag, dismiss op. Web push delivery deferred.
- `projects-new.ts` — clones `github.com/Omnib0mb3r/dev-template`, fills `devneural.jsonc`, opens VS Code on host.
- `routes.ts` — registers every endpoint on Fastify with auth pre-handler.

Daemon now binds `0.0.0.0:3747` by default. New deps: `bcryptjs`, `@fastify/cookie`, `@fastify/multipart`, `@types/bcryptjs`.

### Phase 3.2: Reference corpus pipeline (commit `253090e`)

New module `07-daemon/src/reference/`:
- `chunk.ts` — paragraph-aware chunking, sentence-fallback for oversize paragraphs. Target 800 chars, 100-char overlap, min 200 (smaller merge into neighbors).
- `pdf.ts` — `pdf-parse` for text extraction. Warns when output looks scanned.
- `image.ts` — `tesseract.js` OCR (English default).
- `store.ts` — `ReferenceStore` class. Owns `reference_chunks` Chroma collection, `reference_meta` SQLite table, `reference_fts` FTS5 virtual table. Detects kind from extension.
- `process.ts` — `ingestUpload` pipeline. Saves original, extracts text, chunks, embeds, persists `chunks.jsonl`, builds FTS index.

Endpoints:
- `POST /upload` (multipart): file + optional `project_id` + optional `tags`. Single-pass parts iterator (field order doesn't matter). 100MB default cap (`DEVNEURAL_UPLOAD_MAX_BYTES`).
- `GET /reference` — list docs with optional `project_id` filter.
- `GET /reference/:doc_id` — per-doc detail.

`/search/all` extended to include `reference_chunk` source.

Storage:
```
c:/dev/data/skill-connections/reference/
  docs/<doc-id>/{original.<ext>, text.md, chunks.jsonl}
  images/<doc-id>/...
```

Audio/video deferred to Phase 3.5. New deps: `pdf-parse`, `tesseract.js`, `mammoth`, `@types/pdf-parse`.

### Phase 3.3: Session bridge VS Code extension (commit `4707385`)

New module `09-bridge/` (VS Code extension, local install only).

- `09-bridge/src/extension.ts` — activates on VS Code startup, polls `session-bridge/*.in` every 750ms with persisted byte-offset reader. Parses BridgeMessage JSON lines: `{queued_at, text}` sends to terminal, `{queued_at, action: "focus"}` brings window forward. Picks target terminal by case-insensitive substring match against pattern (default `claude`). Multi-window VS Code: each window only acts on messages whose session_id maps via `session-state/<id>.meta.json` to a cwd starting with this window's workspace folder.

Configuration (`devneural.bridge.*`):
- `enabled` (default true)
- `dataRoot` (must match daemon's `DEVNEURAL_DATA_ROOT`)
- `terminalNamePattern` (default `claude`)

Commands: `Bridge Status`, `Toggle Bridge`, `Pick Claude Terminal for This Window`.

Install:
```powershell
cd C:/dev/Projects/DevNeural/09-bridge
npm install
npm run build
npm run package
code --install-extension devneural-bridge.vsix
```

End-to-end loop now closes:
```
Dashboard / curl POSTs prompt to /sessions/<id>/prompt
  → daemon writes JSON line to session-bridge/<id>.in
  → bridge reads new offset, picks terminal, sendText(text, addNewLine=true)
  → Claude in the terminal sees the prompt as if typed.
```

---

## What's next

Phase 3 is substantively complete. What's actually left:

### 3.5 Audio + video processing (NEEDS BINARIES)

Daemon side. The reference pipeline currently handles PDF, image, markdown, DOCX. Audio and video need:

- **whisper.cpp** built locally on OTLCDEV (`base.en` default model). Wrapper TS module at `07-daemon/src/reference/audio.ts` to spawn the binary on incoming uploads.
- **ffmpeg** in PATH. Wrapper at `07-daemon/src/reference/video.ts` to extract audio (and optionally sample frames every N seconds for OCR) before feeding to whisper.
- Wire both into `process.ts` dispatcher kind detection.

This is implementation + binary install. The code skeleton can be written without testing, then validated on OTLCDEV after `winget install Gyan.FFmpeg` and a whisper.cpp build.

### 3.11 PWA icon assets (design work, not code)

`08-dashboard/public/icons/icon-192.png` and `icon-512.png` are referenced from the manifest but not yet created. Real PNG icons need design (the violet brain mark from the dashboard wordmark, exported at both sizes with `purpose: "any maskable"` safe area). Out of scope for a code agent.

### 3.12 Polish pass

- Add Tremor `<SparkAreaChart>` to System panel for CPU/memory trend lines (last 60 samples)
- Add a beforeinstallprompt listener + "install dashboard" affordance on mobile
- Verify `prefers-reduced-motion` shortens every animation across the app
- Run axe via Playwright on every route and fix any criticals
- Replace lingering `text-[11px]` arbitrary classes with `text-nano` utility for consistency

### Phase 4 (Orb rebind)

Explicitly deferred. Spec at `docs/spec/phase-4-orb.md`. The dashboard's `/orb` route is a placeholder card. Phase 4 plugs the wiki graph data model into a force-directed visualization that lands in the same panel.

### Phase 5 (Settings audit)

Personalized. Spec at `docs/spec/phase-5-settings-audit.md`. Walks through every config knob in the daemon and the dashboard and produces a finalized `INSTALL.md` for a fresh OTLCDEV install. Needs the user to walk through it interactively.

## Where the dashboard lives now

```
08-dashboard/
  app/                  # Next.js App Router
    layout.tsx          # root: fonts, providers, service worker
    page.tsx            # Home (daily brief)
    unlock/, set-pin/   # PIN auth pages (Suspense-wrapped)
    sessions/, sessions/[id]/
    wiki/, projects/, system/, reminders/, orb/
  components/           # AppShell, TopBar, StreamDeck, RightRail, VitalsRibbon,
                        # CommandPalette, DailyBrief, SessionsTable, SessionDetail,
                        # SendPromptForm, WikiSearch, UploadModal, ReferenceList,
                        # ProjectsGrid, NewProjectModal, SystemPanel, RemindersPanel,
                        # PushSubscribeButton, RegisterServiceWorker, Icon, StatusDot, PinForm
  lib/
    daemon-client.ts    # typed wrappers for every daemon endpoint
  public/
    manifest.json       # PWA manifest
    sw.js               # service worker (install/activate/push/notificationclick)
  middleware.ts         # cookie presence gate; daemon does signature verification
  next.config.mjs       # rewrites /auth/*, /sessions/*, /dashboard/*, /push/*, etc to localhost:3747
  app/globals.css       # tokens.css inlined under @theme directive (tailwind v4)
  mockup/               # original v4 static mockup, kept as reference baseline
  references/           # reference doc analyses from design pass + verification artifacts
```

Run with the daemon up:

```powershell
cd C:/dev/Projects/DevNeural/07-daemon
npm run start
# in a separate terminal
cd C:/dev/Projects/DevNeural/08-dashboard
npm run dev
# open http://localhost:3000 — first run prompts to set PIN, subsequent prompts to unlock
```

For prod (single-origin, daemon serves the static export): `npm run build` then point the daemon at `08-dashboard/out` as a static dir. That wiring is part of 3.12 polish.

## Critical user preferences (durable, honor every session)

- **Be direct, not verbose.** Called out multiple times for sprawling answers when yes/no would do.
- **Don't barrel into action.** Questions deserve answers, not action. The user explicitly said: "A question is NOT authorization to act. Sometimes the user wants to talk something out first."
- **No em dashes. Anywhere. Ever.**
- **Bluntness over politeness.**
- **Root cause first.** Don't suggest workarounds unless truly the only option.
- **Full file paths.** `C:/dev/Projects/...` not `foo/bar.ts`.
- **Local-first.** No API costs. Local LLM (ollama). Local embedder. Local vector store. No cloud services.
- **Sellability matters.** Decisions consider product polish.
- **Privacy matters.** All data local on `OTLCDEV`.
- **Tailscale is the network perimeter** for remote access.

---

## Important architectural choices

- **In-process vector store, not Chroma server.** `07-daemon/src/store/vector-store.ts`. Linear cosine scan + persistent file format. Single-developer volumes are fine.
- **Local LLM via ollama.** Default `qwen3:8b`, fallback `qwen2.5:7b-instruct`. Set via `DEVNEURAL_OLLAMA_MODEL`.
- **MiniLM embedder via @xenova/transformers.** 384-dim, ONNX. Cached at `c:/dev/data/skill-connections/models/`.
- **SQLite + FTS5** via `better-sqlite3`. WAL mode.
- **Wiki is git-versioned markdown on disk.** Every ingest auto-commits. Hand-readable.
- **Hooks lazy-spawn the daemon.** No need to start manually after install.
- **Five-layer self-loop guards** prevent the daemon from observing its own LLM-driven sessions.
- **Daemon binds 0.0.0.0 by default** for Tailscale. Override with `DEVNEURAL_BIND=127.0.0.1` if you want strict localhost.
- **Reference corpus is a third Chroma collection (`reference_chunks`)** alongside `raw_chunks` and `wiki_pages`. Insights still only come from your own work; uploaded docs are searchable but never become wiki pages.

---

## What's actually testable end-to-end today (no UI)

```powershell
# Status
cd C:/dev/Projects/DevNeural/07-daemon
npm run status

# Start the daemon manually (or let hooks lazy-spawn it)
npm run start

# Hit the API
curl http://127.0.0.1:3747/health
curl http://127.0.0.1:3747/dashboard/health
curl http://127.0.0.1:3747/sessions
curl http://127.0.0.1:3747/services
curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"q":"my query"}' http://127.0.0.1:3747/search/all
curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"title":"test reminder"}' http://127.0.0.1:3747/reminders

# Upload a reference doc
curl -F "project_id=warehouse-sim" -F "tags=manual,conveyor" -F "file=@C:/path/to/manual.pdf" http://127.0.0.1:3747/upload

# Send a prompt to a running Claude session (after installing the bridge)
curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"text":"summarize where we are"}' http://127.0.0.1:3747/sessions/<session-id>/prompt

# Read the wiki directly (markdown on disk)
ls C:/dev/data/skill-connections/wiki/pending/
ls C:/dev/data/skill-connections/wiki/pages/
```

## Open questions / pending decisions

1. **Phase 3.4 dashboard frontend: when to start?** Phases 3.1, 3.2, 3.3 done. User has not yet authorized the Next.js scaffold.
2. **Project status board (Kanban)** scope inside 3.4. Stage source of truth stays `devneural.jsonc`. Confirm before building.
3. **Self-update mechanism for the daemon.** Currently `git pull && npm install && npm run build`. Could automate. Deferred.
4. **Reference-corpus image processing:** tesseract default. Vision model upgrade is opt-in via env, lands later.
5. **Daily brief generator:** local Qwen vs hybrid (Haiku for the brief only). User committed to local-only.
6. **Scanned PDF OCR fallback:** currently extracts only existing text and warns. Rasterize-then-OCR fallback (pdf2pic + tesseract) is a future polish item.
7. **PWA push notifications:** deferred to 3.7. Need VAPID keys generated + service worker.
8. **Multi-window session targeting:** the bridge falls back to "all windows try" when `session-state/<id>.meta.json` doesn't exist yet. Acceptable for solo use.

## How the user works (style notes)

- Types fast, doesn't always proofread. Treat typos as obvious; don't ask for clarification on simple ones.
- "Move on" / "next" = proceed to next phase or step without ceremony.
- "Lets keep talking" / "table that" = no action yet, conversation mode.
- "Don't build yet" = capture in a doc, do not implement.
- Approval cues: "yeah," "ok," "go," "do it," "perfect," "continue," "cook." These authorize action.
- Frustration cues: "im asking a simple fucking question," "dont be lazy," "just do it." When you see these, you've been verbose or evasive. Trim and act.
- The user often pastes content from other sessions. Treat pasted content as input, not as the user's authoring.

---

## Known gotchas

- **Windows `kill $!` in bash does NOT kill node.exe.** Kills the bash subshell. Use `taskkill /F /PID <pid>`. I orphaned daemons twice doing this.
- **`CLAUDE_CODE_ENTRYPOINT`** can be `claude-vscode` (added to allowed list in self-loop guards). Don't remove.
- **Hook stdout becomes additional context** in Claude. Anything written to stdout from `hook-runner.ts` lands in the prompt. Be careful.
- **Daemon log can grow forever** in v1. No rotation yet. Manual truncate if huge.
- **Wiki git auto-commit** runs on every ingest. If something breaks the wiki repo (manual edit, merge conflict), every subsequent ingest fails the commit step but the page write still succeeds. Check `daemon.log` for git errors.
- **Initial corpus seed** runs in background on first daemon launch IF ollama is configured AND not already seeded. State at `corpus-seed.state.json`. Force re-run with `POST /reseed`.
- **Multipart upload field order:** the `/upload` endpoint uses a single-pass parts iterator. Field order in the multipart body does not matter (early bug fixed in P3.2).
- **Bridge target terminal:** uses substring match on terminal name (default `claude`). If your Claude terminal has a different name, run `DevNeural: Pick Claude Terminal for This Window` in the command palette.
- **Bridge multi-window routing:** falls back to "all windows attempt" if `session-state/<id>.meta.json` does not exist. The session summarizer creates these files; new sessions may take a few minutes before the meta exists.
- **Daemon now binds 0.0.0.0:3747** to allow Tailscale routing. If you want strict localhost: `DEVNEURAL_BIND=127.0.0.1`.

---

## What's NOT done that some might expect

- **Dashboard frontend:** Phase 3.4. Endpoints exist, no UI yet.
- **Audio + video processing:** Phase 3.5. PDF / image / markdown / DOCX work today.
- **Web push notifications:** Phase 3.7. Storage works, push delivery doesn't.
- **Orb rebind:** Phase 4. Old v1 orb code unchanged in `03-web-app/`.
- **05-voice-interface:** untouched, will reshape later.
- **06-notebooklm-integration:** untouched, will reshape later.
- **Autostart on Windows boot:** documented as manual Task Scheduler entry. A polished install path is part of Phase 8.
- **Personalized settings audit:** Phase 5. Install docs hold structure; personalized contents deferred.
- **Project status board (Kanban):** spec'd as part of Phase 3.4 dashboard. Replaces dead monday integration. UI not built.
- **Scanned PDF OCR fallback:** PDFs that are image-only get warned, not auto-OCR'd. A future polish task.

---

## How to start the next session productively

1. Read this file.
2. Read the most recent commit message: `git log -1`.
3. If the user hasn't given direction yet, ask "Phase 3.4 dashboard frontend next, correct?" and wait.
4. If the user gives a direction, follow it. Don't re-litigate the spec.
