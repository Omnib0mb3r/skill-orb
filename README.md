# DevNeural

> Your second brain. Local. Learning. Watching. Surfacing what matters when you need it.

DevNeural is a personal second brain for software work. It captures everything you do in Claude Code, builds a semantic search layer (RAG) over the raw record, compiles transferable insights into a maintained wiki, recommends relevant prior thinking to Claude in real time, learns from what actually works, and surfaces it all through a dashboard you can hit from anywhere via Tailscale.

It runs entirely on your own hardware. No API costs. No cloud. Your data never leaves your machine.

---

## What it is

A second brain has six properties. DevNeural has all six.

| Property | DevNeural |
|---|---|
| **Persistent memory** across sessions, projects, and time | Wiki + RAG layers stored locally, versioned in git |
| **Semantic recall** (you remember the shape of a problem, not the words) | Local embedder + vector search over wiki and raw transcripts |
| **Watches and learns without being asked** | Claude Code hooks + transcript watcher capture continuously |
| **Surfaces relevant prior thinking in real time** | At every prompt, the curator injects the most useful 600 tokens |
| **Compounds with use** | Reinforcement loop: useful injections strengthen, ignored ones decay |
| **Lives entirely on your hardware** | Local LLM (ollama), local embedder (ONNX), local vector store, local wiki |

## First-time setup checklist

Run these once on `OTLCDEV` (the host machine) in order. Each step is idempotent; re-running does nothing harmful.

```powershell
# 1. Prereqs (one-shot, see docs/install/01-prerequisites.md for the long version)
winget install OpenJS.NodeJS.LTS
winget install Git.Git
winget install Ollama.Ollama
winget install Microsoft.VisualStudioCode
winget install Tailscale.Tailscale
winget install Anthropic.Claude
winget install Gyan.FFmpeg                                  # Phase 3.5 audio/video, optional
ollama pull qwen3:8b                                        # local LLM

# 2. Clone + build the daemon
git clone https://github.com/Omnib0mb3r/DevNeural C:\dev\Projects\DevNeural
cd C:\dev\Projects\DevNeural\07-daemon
npm install
npm run setup                                               # builds, scaffolds wiki, verifies ollama
npm run install-hooks                                       # registers v2 hooks; backs up settings.json first
npm run dedupe-hooks                                        # optional cleanup of duplicates from other installers

# 3. Build the dashboard for production serve
cd C:\dev\Projects\DevNeural\08-dashboard
npm install --legacy-peer-deps
$env:NODE_ENV='production'; npx next build                  # produces 08-dashboard/out/

# 4. Install the session bridge (lets the dashboard send prompts to running Claude terminals)
cd C:\dev\Projects\DevNeural\09-bridge
npm install
npm run build
npm run package
code --install-extension devneural-bridge.vsix

# 5. Schedule the daily backup (CRITICAL — your data root is the irreplaceable thing)
cd C:\dev\Projects\DevNeural\07-daemon
npm run install-backup-task                                 # default: daily 03:00, keep 14 snapshots locally
# Recommended: redirect to OneDrive or an external drive for off-machine durability:
# npm run install-backup-task -- -BackupRoot "$env:USERPROFILE\OneDrive\devneural-backups"

# 6. Start the daemon
npm run start                                               # listens on 0.0.0.0:3747, serves the dashboard at /
```

Then open `http://localhost:3747` in a browser, set a PIN on first launch, and you're in.

For Tailscale remote access from your phone, follow [docs/install/TAILSCALE.md](docs/install/TAILSCALE.md). For audio/video uploads, follow [docs/install/AUDIO-VIDEO.md](docs/install/AUDIO-VIDEO.md). For full-machine recovery, follow [docs/install/08-personalized-recovery.md](docs/install/08-personalized-recovery.md).

## Capabilities at a glance

| Capability | What it does |
|---|---|
| **RAG layer** | Every transcript chunk and uploaded doc embedded into local vector store. Semantic recall by meaning, not keywords. |
| **Learning wiki** | LLM-compiled markdown pages following a `[trigger] → [insight]` schema. Edges are explicit cross-references. |
| **Recommendation engine** | At every Claude prompt, top-relevance page injected as additional context. Below threshold = silence. Better nothing than noise. |
| **Cross-project intelligence** | Insights observed in two or more projects promote to global. The brain spans your work, not one repo. |
| **Reference corpus** | Upload manuals, books, PDFs, images, DOCX. Local OCR + chunking. Audio + video pipeline ships behind whisper.cpp + ffmpeg. |
| **Reinforcement** | Useful injections raise page weight; corrections lower it; unused pages decay. Empirical, not editorial. |
| **Dashboard** | Central hub on port 3747. Sessions, projects, search, system metrics with sparklines, daily brief, reminders, web push, force-directed wiki graph (Orb). PWA-installable on phone. Tailscale for remote access. |
| **Backup pipeline** | Daily scheduled snapshot of the data root with SQLite atomic capture, manifest, integrity verification, and rotation. |
| **Local-first** | Default LLM is ollama (qwen3:8b). Anthropic API supported as fallback. Zero cost in default config. |

## The two layers

DevNeural is built on two complementary layers. Neither alone is sufficient.

**Semantics layer (meaning-based).** Vector embeddings, cosine similarity, two-tier retrieval. This is what lets you recall by intent. "The warehouse layout decision" finds work where you didn't use those words.

**Logic layer (rules-based).** The structured `[trigger] → [insight]` page schema, validation gates on every LLM output, promotion criteria, reinforcement rules, hard editorial rules. This is what keeps the wiki from becoming a junk drawer.

Without semantics: a junk drawer of insights nobody can find. Without logic: a vector store of noise that scores high but means nothing. The combination is what makes the wiki a brain.

See [docs/spec/devneural-v2.md section 7](docs/spec/devneural-v2.md) for the full breakdown.

## Operations cheat sheet

```powershell
cd C:\dev\Projects\DevNeural\07-daemon

npm run start                       # daemon on :3747 (serves dashboard)
npm run status                      # health check across daemon, ollama, hooks, data root
npm run install-hooks               # re-register hooks (idempotent, backs up settings)
npm run dedupe-hooks                # remove duplicate hooks from other installers
npm run backup                      # one-shot snapshot
npm run verify-backup               # PRAGMA integrity_check + JSON parse on latest snapshot
npm run restore                     # restore latest (refuses while daemon is up)
npm run install-backup-task         # daily 03:00, retain 14
npm test                            # 53 unit tests
```

Dashboard:

```powershell
cd C:\dev\Projects\DevNeural\08-dashboard
npm run dev                         # localhost:3000 with rewrite proxy to daemon for development
$env:NODE_ENV='production'; npx next build       # static export to out/, daemon serves it
```

## Why this exists

Because Claude forgets between sessions, and you forget between projects. Together you keep solving the same problems in slightly different ways. DevNeural is the persistent layer that makes both of you smarter at your actual work, while keeping every byte on your own machine.
